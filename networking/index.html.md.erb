This section introduces some of the networking and routing security options for your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment.

## <a id="secure_traffic"></a> Securing Traffic and Controlling Routes

You can enable and configure a number of customization options to secure traffic in and out of your PCF deployment.

## <a id="use_ipsec"></a> Using the IPsec Add-On

The IPsec add-on for PCF provides additional security to the network layer for each BOSH-deployed virtual machine (VM).

The PCF IPsec add-on secures network traffic within a Cloud Foundry deployment and provides internal system protection if a malicious actor breaches your firewall.
