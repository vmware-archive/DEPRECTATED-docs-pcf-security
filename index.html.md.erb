##<a id='who'></a>For Security Professionals and PCF Users

This guide explains how Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) manages network access, roles and permissions, internal communications, container hardening, and other security issues. It is intended to give security professionals a complete view of PCF security, and to help all PCF users, not just the security experts, keep the platform secure.

##<a id='cves'></a>Current Security Reports

Pivotal publishes security updates regularly in response to privately- and publicly-reported Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).

See the latest CVEs on the [Pivotal Application Security Team](https://pivotal.io/security) page.

To learn about Pivotal's vulnerability reporting and responsible disclosure process, read [PCF Security Overview and Policy](./process/pcf-security.html).
