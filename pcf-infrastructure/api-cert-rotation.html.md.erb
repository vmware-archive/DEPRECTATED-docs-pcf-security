This topic describes how to check the expiration date of and rotate the Ops Manager root Certificate Authority (CA), BOSH NATS CA, and leaf certificates in <%= vars.first_product_name  %> that are visible to the Ops Manager API.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The rotation procedures described in this topic do not work if the certificates have already expired. If the certificates have expired, contact <a href="https://support.pivotal.io/">Pivotal Support</a> for guidance.</p>

For information about rotating IPsec certificates, see [Rotating IPsec Certificates](../../../addon-ipsec/1-8/credentials.html).

For information about using trusted third-party certificates for both apps hosted on PCF and internal PCF components, see [Setting Trusted Certificates](/platform/ops-manager/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.', '-') %>/trusted-certificates.html).


## <a id='intro'></a> Overview

The Ops Manager API manages and lists internal Certificate Authorities (CAs) and leaf certificates that enable PCF components to communicate with each other securely using TLS. It can also list certificates used externally, such as SAML certificates that authenticate to an external identity provider. 

For more information about root CAs and leaf certificates, see [Certificate Types](certificate-types.html).

Rotate root CAs and leaf certificates before they expire to avoid downtime for your foundation.


## <a id='procedure'></a> Procedure

This section explains how to rotate the Ops Manager root CA, BOSH NATS CA, and leaf certificates in <%= vars.product_name %>.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The BOSH NATS CA is automatically rotated when you rotate the Ops Manager root CA. For more information, see <a href="./certificate-types.html">Certificate Types</a>.</p>

To rotate root CAs and leaf certificates in PCF, do the following:

1. Check the expiration dates of the root CA and leaf certificates, and identify the types of leaf certificates that require rotation. See [Check Expiration Dates and Certificate Types](#checks).

1. Rotate the certificates that expire soon. See [Rotate Certificates](#rotate).


### <a id='checks'></a> Check Expiration Dates and Certificate Types

This section describes how to check the expiration dates of the root CA and leaf certificates that the Ops Manager API lists and manages. It also explains how to identify the types of leaf certificates that expire soon and require manual rotation. 

After identifying the types of certificates that expire soon, you can determine which certificate rotation procedure to follow. 


#### <a id='root-expiry'></a> Check Root CA Expiration Date

This procedure describes how to check the expiration date for the Ops Manager root CA. The Ops Manager root CA expires four years after creation. 

To check the Ops Manager root CA expiration date, do the following:

1. Perform the steps in the [Using Ops Manager API](../../customizing/ops-man-api.html) topic to target and authenticate with the Ops Manager User Account and Authentication (UAA) server. Record your Ops Manager access token, and use it for `YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` in the steps below.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you record your Ops Manager access token, remove any newline characters such as <code>\n</code>.</p>

1. To retrieve the Ops Manager root CA, use `curl` to make an Ops Manager API call to the `https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities` endpoint. For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    curl "https<span>:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities" \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
    </pre>

1. To make the JSON output more readable, you can pipe it to [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) or another text editor with JSON formatting.

1. In the `certificate_authorities` list returned, if there is more than one, find the CA with `"active": true`.

1. To determine its expiration date of the active CA, refer to its `expires_on` value. For example, the root CA shown below expires on September 5, 2019:
    <pre class='terminal'>
{
  "certificate\_authorities": [
    {
      "guid": "9c9a110c8f82a1e4aaca",
      "issuer": "Pivotal",
      "created\_on": "2017-09-05T22:47:53Z",
      "expires\_on": "2019-09-05T22:47:53Z",
      "active": true,
      "cert_pem": "\-\-\-\-\-BEGIN CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-\
      [...]
      \n-----END CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-\n"
    </pre>

#### <a id='leaf-expiry'></a> Check Leaf Certificate Expiration Dates and Types

This procedure describes how to check the expiration dates of leaf certificates using the `deployed/certificates` endpoint. It also describes how to identify non-configurable, configurable, and non-rotatable leaf certificates in the output from the `deployed/certificates` endpoint.  

To check the expiration dates of leaf certificates and identify the types of leaf certificates that expire soon, do the following:

1. If you haven't already, perform the steps in the [Using Ops Manager API](../../customizing/ops-man-api.html) topic to target and authenticate with the Ops Manager User Account and Authentication (UAA) server. Record your Ops Manager access token, and use it for `YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` in the steps below.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you record your Ops Manager access token, remove any newline characters such as <code>\n</code>.</p>

1. To check the system for certificates that expire within a given time interval, use `curl` to call the `https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=TIME` API endpoint, replacing `TIME` with an integer-letter code.
    Valid letter codes are `d` for days, `w` for weeks, `m` for months, and `y` for years.<br><br>
    For example, the following command searches for certificates expiring within six months:
    <pre>
    curl "https<span>:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires\_within=6m" \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
    </pre>
    Where `YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is the <code>access\_token</code> value you recorded in the previous step.

1. To make the JSON output more readable, pipe it to [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) or another text editor with JSON formatting.

1. To determine the expiration date of each certificate, refer to its `expires_on` value.

1. Identify the types of leaf certificates requiring rotation. The following rules identify the type of each leaf certificate:
  * **Non-Rotatable Certificates**: Non-Rotatable leaf certificates have the following property value: `variable_path` is `/opsmgr/bosh_dns/tls_ca`  
  * **Non-Configurable Certificates**: Non-Configurable leaf certificates have the following property values and are not non-rotatable as identified above:
      * `configurable` is `false`
      * `location` is either `ops_manager` or `credhub`
  * **Configurable Certificates**: Configurable leaf certificates have the following property value: `configurable` is `true`

1. Continue to [Rotate Certificates](#rotate) with your list of certificate types that expire soon.

### <a id='rotate'></a> Rotate Certificates

This section includes procedures for rotating root CAs and leaf certificates. There are different rotation procedures for each type of certificate that requires rotation. 

You can determine which rotation procedure to follow based on the types of certificates in your foundation that must be rotated.  For more information about identifying the types of certificates in your foundation that expire soon, see [Check Expiration Dates and Certificate Types](#checks).

To rotate certificates, do one of the following procedures:

* To rotate non-rotatable certificates, call [Pivotal Support](http://support.pivotal.io).

* To rotate the Ops Manager root CA, follow the [Rotate the Root CA and Leaf Certificates](#rotate-ca) procedure. This procedure automatically rotates all non-configurable leaf certificates and the BOSH NATS CA. You can also optionally rotate configurable leaf certificates as part of this procedure.

* To rotate non-configurable leaf certificates, but not the root CA, follow the [Rotate Non-Configurable Leaf Certificates](#regenerate) procedure.

* To rotate configurable leaf certificates, but not the root CA, follow the [Rotate Configurable Leaf Certificates](#rotate-config) procedure.

#### <a id='rotate-ca'></a> Rotate the Root CA and Leaf Certificates

This procedure uses the Ops Manager API to rotate the Ops Manager root CA, BOSH NATS CA, and non-configurable leaf certificates. Rotating the Ops Manager root CA automatically rotates the BOSH NATS CA and all non-configurable leaf certificates.

To prevent system downtime, this procedure includes two BOSH deploys. The first BOSH deploy applies new certificates to <%= vars.product_name %> components. The second BOSH deploy deletes the old certificates.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> You must complete these steps in the exact order specified. Otherwise, you may damage your deployment.</p>

To rotate the Ops Manager root CA and leaf certificates:

1. Add a new root CA. See [Add a New Root CA](#add-new-ca).

1. Activate the root CA. [Activate the Root CA](#activate-new-ca).

1. (Optional) Rotate leaf configurable certificates. See [Rotate Configurable Leaf Certificates](#rotate-config-after-new-root). 

1. Rotate non-configurable leaf certificates. See [Rotate Non-Configurable Leaf Certificates from the New Root](#regenerate-from-new-root).

1. (Optional) Delete the old CA. See [Delete the Old CA](#delete).

<a id='add-new-ca'></a> <strong>Step 1: Add a New Root CA</strong>

Follow this procedure to add a new root CA for Ops Manager. The new root CA can be a Pivotal-generated CA or your own custom CA.

This procedure also automatically regenerates the BOSH NATS CA.

To add a new root CA for Ops Manager and regenerate the BOSH NATS CA:

1. If you haven't already, perform the steps in the [Using Ops Manager API](../../customizing/ops-man-api.html) topic to target and authenticate with the Ops Manager User Account and Authentication (UAA) server. Record your Ops Manager access token, and use it for `YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` in the following steps.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you record your Ops Manager access token, remove any newline characters such as <code>\n</code>.</p>

1. Use Ops Manager to generate a new CA, or else add your own custom CA:
  <p class ="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) certificates are not supported in <%= vars.product_name %>.</p>
  * **To use your own custom CA**, call the Ops Manager API `certificate_authorities` endpoint as follows:
    <pre>
      curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate\_authorities" \
          -X POST \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{"cert\_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\YOUR-CERTIFICATE", "private\_key\_pem": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\YOUR-KEY"}'
    </pre>
    Where:
    <ul><li>`YOUR-CERTIFICATE` is your custom CA.</li> 
      <li>`YOUR-KEY` is your RSA key.</li>
      <li>`YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.</li></ul><p>If the command succeeds, the API returns a response that includes the new CA certificate:</p> 
    <pre class="terminal">
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      {
        "certificate\_authorities": [
          {
            "guid": "f7bc18f34f2a7a9403c3",
            "issuer": "YOUR-CA",
            "created\_on": "2017-01-09",
            "expires\_on": "2021-01-09",
            "active": true,
            "cert\_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIC+zCCAeOgAwIBAgI....etc"
          }
        ]
      }
    </pre> 
  * **To use a Pivotal-generated CA**, call the Ops Manager API `generate` endpoint as follows:
    <pre>
      curl "http<span>s</span>://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate\_authorities/generate" \
            -X POST \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{}'
    </pre>
      Where `YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.
    </br>
    </br>
      If the command succeeds, the API returns a response that includes the new CA certificate:
    <pre class="terminal">

            "
    </pre>

1. Confirm that your new CA has been added by listing all of the root CAs for Ops Manager:
  <pre>
  curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate\_authorities" \
        -X GET \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
  </pre>
  The API call returns the GUID of the newly added CA. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    {
      "certificate\_authorities": [
        {
          "guid": "f7bc18f34f2a7a9403c3",
          "issuer": "Pivotal",
          "created\_on": "2017-01-09",
          "expires\_on": "2021-01-09",
          "active": true,
          "cert\_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIC+zCCAeOgAwIBAgI....etc"
        }
        {
          "guid": "a8ee01e33e3e3e3303e3",
          "issuer": "Pivotal",
          "created\_on": "2017-04-09",
          "expires\_on": "2021-04-09",
          "active": false,
          "cert\_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\zBBBC+eAAAe1gAwAAAeZ....etc"
        }
      ]
    }
  </pre>
  Identify your newly added CA, which has `active` set to `false`. Record its GUID.

1. Navigate to `https://OPS-MAN-FQDN` in a browser and log in to Ops Manager.

1. Click the **BOSH Director** tile in the **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Select the **Director Config** pane.

1. Select **Recreate All VMs**. This propagates the new CA to all VMs to prevent downtime.

1. Go back to the Installation Dashboard. For each service tile you have installed:

    1. Click the tile.

    1. Click the **Errands** tab.

    1. Enable the **Recreate All Service Instances** errand if provided.
    
    1. If you do not see this errand, manually push the BOSH NATS CA to each service instance VM. Run:
      <pre>
      bosh -d SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT recreate
      </pre>
      Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT` is the BOSH deployment name for the service instance. You run this command for each service instance.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes**. When the deploy finishes, continue to the next section.

<a id='activate-new-ca'></a> <strong>Step 2: Activate the Root CA</strong>

To activate the new root CA:

1. Use `curl` to make an Ops Manager API call that activates the new CA:
  <pre>curl "http<span>s</span>://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate\_authorities/CERT-GUID/activate" \
      -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{}'
  </pre>
  Where `CERT-GUID` is the GUID of your CA that you retrieved in the previous section.
  </br>
  </br>
  The API returns a successful response:
  <pre class="terminal">HTTP/1.1 200 OK</pre>

1. List your root CAs again to confirm that the new CA is active:
  <pre>
  curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate\_authorities" \
        -X GET \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
  </pre>
  Examine the response to ensure that your new CA has `active` set to `true`.

<a id='rotate-config-after-new-root'></a> <strong>(Optional) Step 3: Rotate Configurable Leaf Certificates</strong>

If there are any configurable certificates in your foundation expiring soon, Pivotal recommends rotating them now. Rotating configurable leaf certificates now ensures that your next BOSH deploy includes both new configurable and non-configurable leaf certificates.

To rotate configurable leaf certificates, do the following for each configurable certificate that expires soon:

1. Find the text field where the certificate is configured within the Ops Manager interface. You might have to look through multiple configuration panes to identify the location of the certificate configuration text field. Use the following fields to identify the location of the certificate configuration text field:
    * The `product_guid` field in the API output can help identify in which tile the certificate is configured. For example, the prefix `p-bosh-` refers to the BOSH Director tile, and the prefix `cf-` refers to the PAS tile.
    * The `property_reference` field in the API output can help identify in which **Settings** pane the certificate is configured. For example, the `uaa.service_provider_key_credentials` property is configured in the PAS tile > **UAA** pane.

1. Paste a new value for the certificate into the text field.

1. Click **Save** at the bottom of each pane in which you added new certificates.


<a id='regenerate-from-new-root'></a> <strong>Step 4: Rotate Non-Configurable Leaf Certificates from the New Root</strong>

After activating the new root CA, you must rotate non-configurable leaf certificates from the root CA. 

To rotate non-configurable leaf certificates from the new root CA:

1. Use `curl` to make an API call to regenerate all non-configurable certificates and apply the new CA to your existing BOSH Director:
<pre>
  curl "http<span>s</span>://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate\_authorities/active/regenerate" \
        -X POST \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{}'
</pre>
The API returns a successful response:
<pre class="terminal">HTTP/1.1 200 OK</pre>

1. Click the **BOSH Director** tile in the **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Select the **Director Config** pane.

1. Select **Recreate All VMs**. This propagates the new CA to all VMs to prevent downtime.

1. Go back to the Installation Dashboard. For each service tile you have installed, do the following:

    1. Click the tile.

    1. Click the **Errands** tab.

    1. Enable the **Recreate All Service Instances** errand if provided. If you do not see this errand, contact [Pivotal Support](https://pivotal.io/support).

1. Navigate to Ops Manager, click **Review Pending Changes**, and click **Apply Changes** to perform a second redeploy.

<a id='delete'></a> <strong>(Optional) Step 5: Delete the Old CA</strong>

After activating a new root CA and rotating leaf certificates from the new root CA, Pivotal recommends deleting the old root CA from your foundation.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Include the <strong>Review Pending Changes</strong> and <strong>Apply Changes</strong> from <a href="#regenerate-from-new-root">Step 4: Rotate Non-Configurable Leaf Certificates from the New Root</a> before you delete the old CA.</p>

To delete the old root CA, do the following:

1. List your root CAs to retrieve the GUID of your old, inactive CA:
<pre>
  curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate\_authorities" \
        -X GET \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
</pre>

1. Use `curl` to make an API call to delete your old CA:
<pre>
  curl "http<span>s</span>://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate\_authorities/OLD-CERT-GUID" \
        -X DELETE \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
</pre>
Where `OLD-CERT-GUID` is the GUID of your old, inactive CA.
</br>
</br>
The API returns a successful response.
<pre class="terminal">HTTP/1.1 200 OK</pre>

1. Navigate to Ops Manager, click **Review Pending Changes**, and click **Apply Changes**.

#### <a id='regenerate'></a> Rotate Non-Configurable Leaf Certificates

This procedure rotates non-configurable leaf certificates visible to the Ops Manager API, whether they are managed and stored by Ops Manager directly, or by CredHub at Ops Manager request.

<p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> This procedure does not rotate the Ops Manager root CA. To rotate both the root CA and non-configurable leaf certificates, see <a href="#rotate-ca">Rotate the Root CA and Leaf Certificates</a>.</p>

To rotate non-configurable leaf certificates, do the following:

1. Use `curl` to make an API call to regenerate all non-configurable certificates and apply the new CA to your existing BOSH Director:
<pre>
  curl "http<span>s</span>://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate\_authorities/active/regenerate" \
        -X POST \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{}'
</pre>
The API returns a successful response:
<pre class="terminal">HTTP/1.1 200 OK</pre>

1. Navigate to Ops Manager, click **Review Pending Changes**, and click **Apply Changes** to perform a second redeploy.


#### <a id='rotate-config'></a> Rotate Configurable Leaf Certificates

Configurable certificates are generated by the user and pasted into Ops Manager configuration panes where needed. Examples include certificates that terminate SSL traffic into PAS, or authenticate a Single Sign-On (SSO) service plan to an external SAML server.

For instructions on how to rotate SAML certificates for both PAS and the SSO service, see [Rotate Identity Provider SAML Certificates](#rotate-saml-ca).

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> This procedure does not rotate the Ops Manager root CA. To rotate both the root CA and non-configurable leaf certificates, see <a href="#rotate-ca">Rotate the Root CA and Leaf Certificates</a>.</p>

To rotate configurable leaf certificates:

1. If you have not already done so, use the Ops Manager API `deployed/certificates` endpoint to retrieve information about your expiring configurable certificates, as described in the procedures [Check Expiration Dates and Certificate Types](#checks). The information for each configurable certificate looks like this:
  <pre class="terminal">
    {
      "configurable": true,
      "property\_reference": ".properties.networking\_poe\_ssl\_certs[0].certificate",
      "property\_type": "rsa_cert_credentials",
      "product\_guid": "cf-36066831c119c39736d3",
      ...
      "valid\_until": "2019-01-25T22:07:58Z"
    },
  </pre>

1. For each configurable certificate that expires soon:
  1. Find the text field the certificate is configured within the Ops Manager interface.
      * The `product_guid` field in the API output can help identify which tile the certificate is configured in. For example, the prefix `p-bosh-` refers to the BOSH Director tile, and the prefix `cf-` refers to the PAS tile.
      * The `property_reference` field in the API output can often help identify which **Settings** pane the certificate is configured in. For example, the `uaa.service_provider_key_credentials` property is configured in the PAS tile > **UAA** pane.
      * You might have to look through multiple configuration panes to identify where a certificate is configured.
  1. Paste a new value for the certificate into the field
  1. Click **Save** at the bottom of each pane in which you have provided new certificates.

1. If you are rotating configurable certificates within the [Rotate Root and Leaf Certificates](#rotate-ca) procedure, continue to the next step. Otherwise, if you are rotating configurable leaf certificates only, return to the **Installation Dashboard**, click **Review Pending Changes**, and click **Apply Changes**.

#### <a id='rotate-saml-ca'></a> Rotate Identity Provider SAML Certificates

SAML service provider credentials are one example of configurable certificates in PCF. When PAS is configured to use SAML as an identity provider, it uses a configurable CA certificate to authenticate to an external SAML server, by generating ephemeral certificates that PAS includes in its outbound request message headers. This CA has a two-year expiration period.

In addition, the [SSO](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/index.html) service shares the use of PAS SAML certificates for every SAML external Identity Provider (IdP) integration, such as trust,  partnership, or Federation. You must rotate these in lockstep with PAS.

The following procedure provides an example of how to rotate certificates for each IdP, including temporarily disabling certificate validation on the IdP side during the rotation.

The Knowledge Base article [PCF Advisory - SAML Service Provider Credential Certificates Expire after 2 Years](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/PCF-Advisory---SAML-Service-Provider-Credential-Certificates-Expire-after-2-Years) provides more information about rotating SAML certificates.

SAML service provider credentials are only required for your PAS deployment if all of these conditions are met:

* You are using SSO in production for login to PAS or using the SSO service for login to apps.
* You are using SAML identity providers for PAS or SSO service plans.
* You had Ops Manager generate a certificate for you by clicking the **Generate RSA Certificate** button.
* You are validating the signature of SAML authentication request with your identity provider.

To regenerate and rotate SAML service provider certificates without disrupting PAS or your apps using the SSO service:

1. Disable certificate validation in your identity provider.

1. For PAS, follow the procedure in the table below that corresponds to your use case. This includes downloading and importing a new certificate and updated SAML metadata in your identity provider.
