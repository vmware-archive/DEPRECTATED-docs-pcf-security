This topic describes the sources and uses for certificates to secure both internal and
external networking calls in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).


## <a id="sources"></a>Certificate Sources

Certificates in PCF originate from two of the following sources:

* [Enterprise Root Certificate Authority (CA)](#enterprise-root-ca)

* [CredHub](#credhub)


### <a id="enterprise-root-ca"></a>Enterprise Root CA

An enterprise root CA is able to
grant itself a certificate and create subordinate CAs. Domains require an enterprise root CA to allow
clients to request certificates.

Generating certificates against a root CA is a good implementation for systems that are
static and do not need highly available certificate creation.


### <a id="credhub"></a>CredHub

You can use CredHub as a source for certificates in PCF. These certificates can either
be self-signed or signed by an imported trusted CA. Certificates are self-signed by default.

Use CredHub for the following benefits:

* High availability
* Dynamic generation of certificates
* More secure communication between platform components, applications, and services

Pivotal recommends using CredHub for high availability and good security posture in PCF.

For more information, see [CredHub](../../credhub/index.html).
