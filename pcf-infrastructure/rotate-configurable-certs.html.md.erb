This topic describes how to rotate configurable leaf certificates for your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment. To rotate all certificates in your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment, see [Rotating Certificates](api-cert-rotation.html).


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Configurable certificates are generated by the user and pasted into <%= vars.ops_manager %> configuration panes where needed. Examples include certificates that terminate SSL traffic into <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>), or authenticate a Pivotal Single Sign-On (SSO) service plan to an external SAML server.

To rotate SAML certificates for both <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> and the SS0 service, see [Rotating Identity Provider SAML Certificates](rotate-saml-ca.html).

<p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> This procedure does not rotate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> root certificate authority (CA) or other CAs in your deployment. To rotate CAs and leaf certificates, see <a href="api-cert-rotation.html#rotate-ca">Rotate CAs and Leaf Certificates</a> in <em>Rotating Certificates</em>.</p>

Before rotating configurable leaf certificates, you must check which certificates in your deployment are configurable and when they are due to expire. For more information, see [Check Expiration Dates and Certificate Types](api-cert-rotation.html#checks) in _Rotating Certificates_.


## <a id='procedure'></a> Procedure

To rotate configurable leaf certificates:

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. For each certificate you want to rotate:
  1. Find the text field where the certificate is configured in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI.
      * The `product_guid` field in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API output can help identify the tile in which the certificate is configured. For example, the prefix `p-bosh-` refers to the BOSH Director tile, and the prefix `cf-` refers to the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.
      * The `property_reference` field in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API output can often help identify the configuration pane in which the certificate is configured. For example, the `uaa.service_provider_key_credentials` property is configured in the **UAA** pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.
      * You might need to look through multiple configuration panes to identify where a certificate is configured.
  1. Paste a new value for the certificate into the field.
  1. Click **Save** at the bottom of each pane in which you have provided new certificates.

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes**.
