This topic describes setting up and using CredHub Maestro for CredHub.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

CredHub Maestro is a command-line interface (CLI) that facilitates rotations of certificates in CredHub. Using CredHub Maestro, you can:

* Determine if any of your CredHub certificates are expiring soon

* Rotate CredHub certificates

* Clean up inactive certificate versions so that CredHub does not run out of disk space

CredHub Maestro is available in Pivotal Platform Ops Manager v2.8 and later.

To use Maestro outside Ops Manager environments, contact [Pivotal Support](https://pivotal.io/support).
